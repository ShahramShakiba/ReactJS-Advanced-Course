* lets you skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged.
- This can be used to optimize the performance of your components. 

  - memo() compares prop values
?  OLD PROPS VALUE  ðŸ”›  NEW PROPS VALUES
   - Equal :
     Counter-Component function WILL NOT execute

    - Counter-Component will re-executed if :
      . initialCount changed
      . or internal state changed


? DO NOT Overuse memo() :
  - use it as high up in the component tree as possible
    . blocking a component execution there will also block all child component executions

  - Checking props with memo "costs performance"
    . don't wrap it around all your components - it will just add a lot of unnecessary checks

  - DO NOT USE it on components where props will change frequently
    . like SearchBar / InputField etc.
    . memo() would just perform a meaningless check in such cases(which costs performance)
*/

/* useCallback( fn, [] )
  - to avoid of recreation of a function if you have a function as a dependency of useEffect

  - needed in conjunction with memo to avoid unnecessary re-executions

  [] here dependency is setCounter which is a state updating fn and state-updating fn are guaranteed to never change by react, that's why we don't need to add them to this dependency array.
*/

/* useMemo ()
  - is wrapped around normal fn that are executed in Component-Functions to prevent their execution

  - it should be used if you have a Complex Calculation that you want to prevent

  - useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders. |  to cache a calculation between re-renders

? const initialCountIsPrime = useMemo(
?    () => isPrime(initialCount),

    - it won't get executed if the "counter-state" changed
